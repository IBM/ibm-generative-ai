This is a sample of a neurips_impact_statement_risks dataset taken from HuggingFace ought/raft collection licensed under

CONSIDERATIONS:

This dataset has limitations that should be taken into consideration when using it. In particular, the method used to
collect broader impact statements involved automated downloads, conversions and scraping and was not error-proof.
Although care has been taken to identify and correct as many errors as possible, not all texts have been reviewed by a
human. This means it is possible some of the broader impact statements contained in the dataset are truncated or
otherwise incorrectly extracted from their original article.

The dataset contains authors' names. These were scraped from publicly available scientific papers submitted to
NeurIPS 2020.

NeurIPS impact statement risks Volunteers working with researchers affiliated to Oxford's Future of Humanity
Institute (Carolyn Ashurst, now at The Alan Turing Institute) created the impact statements dataset.

TAI Safety Research Don't use it to create a dangerous AI that could bring the end of days.

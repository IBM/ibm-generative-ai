.. admonition:: Migration to V3
   :class: tip

   We recently updated the SDK with improved moderations and schemas. See the :doc:`V3 Migration Guide <v3_migration_guide>`.

.. admonition:: Migration to V2
   :class: tip

   We rewrote nearly the whole SDK to be faster and more reliable than V1 and would bring you all the latest features
   available on the API. To easily migrate, we prepared the :doc:`V2 Migration Guide <v2_migration_guide>`.

Top Features
------------

✅ Very Performant.

✅ Generated Typings directly from the API.

✅ Smart Requests Concurrency Handling.

✅ Retry Mechanism in case of network or API failure.

✅ Batching Large Requests automatically.

✅ Easy to extend (see :ref:`example <examples.extensions.extra>`).

✅ Integrations to :ref:`LangChain <examples.extensions.langchain>`, :ref:`LLamaIndex <examples.extensions.llama_index>` and :ref:`HuggingFace <examples.extensions.huggingface>`.

✅ :ref:`LocalServer extension <examples.extensions.localserver>` – run local API compatible with SDK.



First Steps
-----------

To start using the SDK and the power of generative AI, ensure you have an API key from one of the supported environments.
Then jump straight into :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` page and explore all prepared :doc:`examples <rst_source/examples>`.

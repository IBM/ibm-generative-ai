.. admonition:: Migration to V2
   :class: tip

   We recently rewrote nearly the whole SDK to be faster and more reliable and would bring you all the latest features
   available on the API. To easily migrate, we prepared the doc:`Migration Guide <v2_migration_guide>`.


First Steps
-----------

To start using the SDK and the power of generative AI, ensure you have an API key from one of the supported environments.
Then jupp straight into :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` page and explore all prepared :doc:`examples <rst_source/examples>`.
